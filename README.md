# Stock-Market-Project
This is my version of the chapter 20 SafeTrade Project from the textbook, with some minor adjustments having been made. The project is divided into 9 classes, 3 of which provide the gui and were already coded, and the other 6 which I made. Most of the classes are pretty simple, with the stock and trader classes being the most difficult ones. The main things I learned were hashmaps, treemaps, and priority queues, which were interesting but hard to learn to use. As an additional feature, I added a RandomTrader class, which took the other end of the trades made by users to make the program feel more realistic. If I had more time, I would have designed the random traders to also interact with each other, so that I could replicate like a mini stock exchange. I also wanted to add real stocks and link their prices to real life price changes, but I figured that would hvave taken way too long. To use the program is pretty easy. Just run teh safetrade calss, create a new user account, log yourself in, and then pull the quotes on some trades and get trading. If a trade is reasonable, a bot will taek it and it will be fun. If not, you will have to make the opposite side of the trade yourself.
